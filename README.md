# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to apply our understanding of ETL to Big Data. Within this analysis, we access a large datset provided by amazon, explore some features of the data, transform the data using Pyspark and google colab. and extract the data to a databse using AWS and pgAdmin. In this process, we demonstrate the conecept of ETL on Big Data

## Reuslts
Based on our findings, there are:
- 21 Vine reviews
- 7685 Non-vine reviews
- 11 Vine five-star reviews
- 4443 Non-Vine five-star reviews
- 52.38% Vine reviews were five-star
- 57.81% Non-Vine reviews were five-star

## Summary
It does not seem that there is a positivity bias in the reviews in the Vine program given that the percentage of 5-Star Vine reviews were roughly 50%. To support this claim, it may be of interest to also explore the average rating of Vine program reviews in comparision to the average in Non-Vine program reviews
